                <h2>How to make an impact on climate change by taking actions that bring you joy</h2>

                <p class="lead-text">What if the most effective ways to fight climate change made you happy?</p>

                <p>Psychologist Elizabeth Dunn and climate behavior scientist Jiaying Zhao challenge everything we think
                    we know about sustainable living. While most climate advice demands self-denial—eat less, travel
                    less, want less—this groundbreaking book offers a counterintuitive truth: you can make your life
                    better while saving our species at the same time. The authors reveal how tweaking everyday decisions
                    around food, travel, housing, and shopping can nudge us toward a tipping point of mass
                    action—without tipping us into burnout.</p>

                <h3>You will discover that:</h3>

                <ul class="discovery-list">
                    <li><strong>Joy is a powerful climate strategy.</strong> When you enjoy the changes you're making,
                        you're more likely to stick with them—and spread them.</li>

                    <li><strong>You don't have to go vegan or give up flying.</strong> Smart substitutions (chicken
                        over
                        beef, carry-on over checked bags) make a real dent in emissions with less personal friction.
                    </li>

                    <li><strong>Small talk matters.</strong> Normalizing climate conversations with friends and family
                        helps shift social norms and catalyzes cultural change.</li>

                    <li><strong>Give yourself permission to leave the lights on.</strong> Focus on higher-impact
                        actions instead of smaller interventions.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="closing-text"><em>Leave the Lights On</em> is a bold invitation to reimagine climate action
                    not as a burden, but as an opportunity to build a brighter future—without guilt, without gloom, and
                    without giving up the things that make life worth living. With warmth, clarity, and a refreshingly
                    optimistic voice, Zhao and Dunn reframe what it means to "do your part." Because sustainability
                    doesn't lie in doing everything, it lies in doing something, joyfully.</p>
